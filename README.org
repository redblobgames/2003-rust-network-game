I am learning Rust+Wasm. This is an extension of https://github.com/redblobgames/2002-rust-chat-server but for a simple grid game instead of a chat system.

* Running

Build the code:

#+begin_src sh
make
#+end_src

Run the server:

#+begin_src sh
make run-server
#+end_src

Then load =build/embed.html= into your browser.
